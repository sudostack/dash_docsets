<h1>Testing Channels</h1>
<p>As developers we typically value tests since they help to ‘future-proof’ our applications by
minimizing regression and provide updated documentation. Phoenix recognizes this and helps
make it easier to write tests by providing conveniences for testing its different parts,
including Channels.</p>
<p>In the Channels Guide, we saw that a “Channel” is a layered system with different
components. Given this, there would be cases when writing unit tests for our Channel
functions may not be enough. We may want to verify that its different moving parts
are working together as we expect. This integration testing would assure us that we
correctly defined our channel route, the channel module, and its callbacks; and that
the lower-level layers such as the PubSub and Transport are configured correctly and
are working as intended.</p>
<h4>The Channel Generator</h4>
<p>As we progress through this guide, it would help to have a concrete example we could
work off of. Phoenix comes with a Mix task for generating a basic channel and tests.
These generated files serve as a good reference for writing channels and their
corresponding tests. Let’s go ahead and generate our Channel:</p>
<pre><code class="console">$ mix phx.gen.channel Room
* creating lib/hello_web/channels/room_channel.ex
* creating test/hello_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs

Add the channel to your `lib/hello_web/channels/user_socket.ex` handler, for example:

    channel &quot;room:lobby&quot;, HelloWeb.RoomChannel</code></pre>
<p>This creates a channel, its test and instructs us to add a channel route in
<code class="inline">lib/hello_web/channels/user_socket.ex</code>. It is important to add the channel route or our
channel won’t function at all!</p>
<h4>The Channel Test Helpers Module</h4>
<p>Upon inspecting the file <code class="inline">test/hello_web/channels/room_channel_test.exs</code>, we see a line that looks like
<code class="inline">use MyAppWeb.ChannelCase</code>. Note - we assume that our app is named <code class="inline">MyApp</code> throughout this guide.
Where does this come from?</p>
<p>When we generate a new Phoenix application, a <code class="inline">test/support/channel_case.ex</code> file is
also generated for us. This file houses the <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.ChannelCase</code> module which we will
use for all our integration tests for our channels. It automatically imports conveniences
for testing channels.</p>
<p>Some of the helper functions provided there are for triggering callback functions in our
channel. The others are there to provide us with special assertions that apply only to channels.</p>
<p>If we need to add our own helper function that we would only use in channel tests, we
would add it to <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.ChannelCase</code> by defining it there and ensuring <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.ChannelCase</code>
is imported every time it is <code class="inline">use</code>d. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">defmodule MyAppWeb.ChannelCase do
  ...

  using do
    quote do
      ...
      import MyAppWeb.ChannelCase
    end
  end

  def a_channel_test_helper() do
    # code here
  end
end</code></pre>
<h4>The Setup Block</h4>
<p>Now that we know that Phoenix provides with a custom Test Case just for channels and what it
provides, we can move on to understanding the rest of <code class="inline">test/hello_web/channelsj/room_channel_test.exs</code>.</p>
<p>First off, is the setup block:</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">setup do
  {:ok, _, socket} =
    socket(&quot;user_id&quot;, %{some: :assign})
    |&gt; subscribe_and_join(RoomChannel, &quot;room:lobby&quot;)

  {:ok, socket: socket}
end</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="inline">setup/2</code> macro comes with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.html"><code class="inline">ExUnit</code></a>which comes out of the box with Elixir. The <code class="inline">do</code> block
passed to <code class="inline">setup/2</code> will get run for each of our tests. Note the line <code class="inline">{:ok, socket: socket}</code>.
That line ensures that the <code class="inline">socket</code> from <code class="inline">subscribe_and_join/3</code> will be accessible to all
our tests. In this way, we won’t need to call <code class="inline">subscribe_and_join/3</code> for every test block we
create.</p>
<p><code class="inline">subscribe_and_join/3</code> emulates the client joining a channel and subscribes the test process
to the given topic. This is a necessary step since clients need to join a channel before they
can send and receive events on that channel.</p>
<h4>Testing a Synchronous Reply</h4>
<p>The first test block in our generated channel test looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">test &quot;ping replies with status ok&quot;, %{socket: socket} do
  ref = push socket, &quot;ping&quot;, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;there&quot;}
  assert_reply ref, :ok, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;there&quot;}
end</code></pre>
<p>This tests the following code in our <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.RoomChannel</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="elixir"># Channels can be used in a request/response fashion
# by sending replies to requests from the client
def handle_in(&quot;ping&quot;, payload, socket) do
  {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket}
end</code></pre>
<p>As is stated in the comment above, we see that a <code class="inline">reply</code> is synchronous since it mimics the request/
response pattern we are familiar with in HTTP. This synchronous reply is best used when we only
want to send an event back to the client when we are done processing the message on the server.
For example, when we save something to the database and then send a message to the client only once
that’s done.</p>
<p>In the <code class="inline">test &quot;ping replies with status ok&quot;, %{socket: socket} do</code> line, we see that we have the
map <code class="inline">%{socket: socket}</code>. This gives us access to the <code class="inline">socket</code> in the setup block.</p>
<p>We emulate the client pushing a message to the channel with <code class="inline">push/3</code>. In the line
<code class="inline">ref = push socket, &quot;ping&quot;, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;there&quot;}</code>, we push the event <code class="inline">&quot;ping&quot;</code> with the payload
<code class="inline">%{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;there&quot;}</code> to the channel. This triggers the <code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callback we have for the
<code class="inline">&quot;ping&quot;</code> event in our channel. Note that we store the <code class="inline">ref</code> since we need that on the next line for
asserting the reply. With <code class="inline">assert_reply ref, :ok, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;there&quot;}</code>, we assert that the
server sends a synchronous reply <code class="inline">:ok, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;there&quot;}</code>. This is how we check that the
<code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callback for the <code class="inline">&quot;ping&quot;</code> was triggered.</p>
<h4>Testing a Broadcast</h4>
<p>It is common to receive messages from the client and broadcast to everyone subscribed to a
current topic. This common pattern is simple to express in Phoenix and is one of the generated
<code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callbacks in our <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.RoomChannel</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">def handle_in(&quot;shout&quot;, payload, socket) do
  broadcast socket, &quot;shout&quot;, payload
  {:noreply, socket}
end</code></pre>
<p>Its corresponding test looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">test &quot;shout broadcasts to room:lobby&quot;, %{socket: socket} do
  push socket, &quot;shout&quot;, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;all&quot;}
  assert_broadcast &quot;shout&quot;, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;all&quot;}
end</code></pre>
<p>We notice that we access the same <code class="inline">socket</code> that is from the setup block. How handy! We also do the
same <code class="inline">push/3</code> as we did in the synchronous reply test. So we <code class="inline">push</code> the <code class="inline">&quot;shout&quot;</code> event with the
payload <code class="inline">%{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;all&quot;}</code>.</p>
<p>Since the <code class="inline">handle_in/3</code> callback for the <code class="inline">&quot;shout&quot;</code> event just broadcasts the same event and payload,
all subscribers in the <code class="inline">&quot;room:lobby&quot;</code> should receive the message. To check that, we do
<code class="inline">assert_broadcast &quot;shout&quot;, %{&quot;hello&quot; =&gt; &quot;all&quot;}</code>.</p>
<h4>Testing an Asynchronous Push from the Server</h4>
<p>The last test in our <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.RoomChannelTest</code> verifies that broadcasts from the server are pushed
to the client. Unlike the previous tests discussed, we are indirectly testing that our channel’s
<code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> callback is triggered. This <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> is defined in our <code class="inline">MyApp.RoomChannel</code> as:</p>
<pre><code class="elixir">def handle_out(event, payload, socket) do
  push socket, event, payload
  {:noreply, socket}
end</code></pre>
<p>Since the <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code> event is only triggered when we call <code class="inline">broadcast/3</code> from our channel,
we will need to emulate that in our test. We do that by calling <code class="inline">broadcast_from</code> or
<code class="inline">broadcast_from!</code>. Both serve the same purpose with the only difference of <code class="inline">broadcast_from!</code>
raising an error when broadcast fails.</p>
<p>The line <code class="inline">broadcast_from! socket, &quot;broadcast&quot;, %{&quot;some&quot; =&gt; &quot;data&quot;}</code> will trigger our <code class="inline">handle_out/3</code>
callback above which pushes the same event and payload back to the client. To test this, we do
<code class="inline">assert_push &quot;broadcast&quot;, %{&quot;some&quot; =&gt; &quot;data&quot;}</code>.</p>
<h4>Wrap-up</h4>
<p>In this guide we tackled all the special assertions that comes with <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.ConnCase</code> and some of
the functions provided that help you test channels by triggering its callbacks. We found
the API for testing channels is largely consistent with the API for Phoenix Channels which makes
it easy to work with.</p>
<p>If interested in learning more about the helpers provided by <code class="inline">MyAppWeb.ChannelCase</code>, check out the
documentation for <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.ChannelTest.html"><code class="inline">Phoenix.ChannelTest</code></a> which is the module that defines those functions.</p>
